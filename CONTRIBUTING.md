# Contributing

Staffbase uses CLAs, or Contributor License Agreements, to manage contributions to Free and Open Source Software projects that it hosts. 

Staffbase uses two versions of the CLA:

- An **Individual CLA** for individual contributors. This can be signed through CLA Assistant when submitting a commit in GitHub.
- A **Corporate CLA**, for companies that would like to sign one CLA for their contributors. Please contact opensource(at)staffbase.com in this case.

Staffbaseâ€™s two CLAs are based on the Apache Software Foundation CLAs that are widely in use for various free and open source software projects. Our changes are generally limited to replacing Staffbase as the licensee, minor formatting changes and headings added for readability, and to comply with our CLA process integrated into GitHub or our processes around signature and management of the software project.
